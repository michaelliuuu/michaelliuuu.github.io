                    <p class="text1">I changed my career as an Electrician to pursue my passion in programming. I love developing personal projects that automate tasks and simplify my daily routine.
                        I am currently looking for a internship as a Software Engineer Intern.</p>
                    <p class="text2">When I'm not working or studying, you can find me outdoors being active. I'm a big fan of exercising and playing various sports, as well as hiking and biking. 
                        I also have a passion for photography, and I'm currently learning to play guitar.</p>
